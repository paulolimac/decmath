A reimplementation of the standard math library to give compatibility with
Decimal by delivering arbitrary precision.

At this point DecMath is mostly finished. However, if you have any suggestions
or want to help (eg. with a pull request) definitely do so on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ElecProg/decmath).

This library builds upon Brian Beck and Christopher Hesse's dmath.
