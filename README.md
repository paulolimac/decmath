DecMath
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElecProg/decmath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ElecProg/decmath)

Reimplementing the standard math library to give compatibility
with Decimal by delivering arbitrary precision.

At this point DecMath is mostly finished. However, if you have any
suggestions or want to help (eg. with a pull request) definitely
do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/ElecProg/decmath).

This library builds upon Brian Beck and Christopher Hesse's dmath.
