DecMath
=======

The main goal I have for now is to implement all functions in the
standard math library for which it would be useful to have an
alternative that uses the Decimal type.

At this point decmath is rather stable but still under heavy development
so if you have any suggestions or want to help out with a pull request
definitely do so on `GitHub`_.

This library builds upon dmath, a project by Brian Beck
<exogen@gmail.com> and Christopher Hesse <christopher.hesse@gmail.com>.
